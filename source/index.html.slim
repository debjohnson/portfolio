      blockquote "The most important product design work is the ugliest."
      cite Paul Adams, VP Product @ Intercom

      p.mt--medium-large Design, at its core, is about problem solving. I use a combination of design thinking and empathy to solve problems in a human-centered way. Some of the principles that guide my design process are:

      ul
        li.list--bulleted__item 
          strong Understand the problem to be solved  
          ' and the person experiencing the problem.
        li.list--bulleted__item 
          strong Talk to users 
          ' and identify 
          strong Jobs to be Done.
        li.list--bulleted__item 
          strong Prototype solutions 
          ' to validate assumptions and explore product directions
        li.list--bulleted__item 
          strong Use feedback 
          ' from users to guide the next iteration of the solution
        li.list--bulleted__item 
          strong Collaborate cross-functionally 
          ' to get diverse perspectives
