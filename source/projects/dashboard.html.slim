      p Neon is an automatic image recommendation product that ingests online videos and finds the most compelling image frames to use as the thumbnail. Neon also collects analytics and click-through data to measure how images are performing on customersâ€™ sites. Customers trying out the product wanted insight into this data to monitor Neon thumbnails and see how much additional value they were getting by using Neon images instead of editor selections. This data was given to them in complicated spreadsheets that were hard to understand. Our goal was to replace these with a beautiful and easy-to-digest dashboard.
